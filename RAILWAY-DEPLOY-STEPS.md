## Railway Deployment Status Checklist

### ‚úÖ What We've Done
- [x] Fixed guest auth route in code
- [x] Verified local build works (guest endpoint returns 200)
- [x] Pushed empty commit to trigger Railway rebuild
- [x] Created test scripts

### üîç Current Status
**Production still returns 404** - Railway hasn't deployed the new version yet.

### üìã Next Steps - Do This Now

#### 1. Manual Railway Deploy (Fastest)
Go to: https://railway.app

1. Select your project
2. Click on **backend service** 
3. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"** button
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

#### 2. Check Railway Environment Variables
While you're in Railway dashboard:
1. Go to **"Variables"** tab
2. Add these if missing:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://smzxjnuqfvpzfzmyxpbp.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<get from Supabase dashboard>
   SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=mqhy49Hqmpq8EtMe8l9/iBOMbYdENzo5L5EMhMXm0t+fH7a0ZhLunfhNVQcinh3PC956XynLZumSWdHzwvCHfg==
   ```

**How to get SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/smzxjnuqfvpzfzmyxpbp
2. Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy **service_role** key (NOT anon key)
4. Paste in Railway variables

#### 3. Test After Deploy
Run this command to verify:
```powershell
.\quick-guest-test.ps1
```

Should see:
```
SUCCESS: Status 200
Token received: eyJhbGci...
Guest user: Guest-XXXXXX
```

### üö® Critical Notes
1. **Don't git push** until you manually verify it works on Railway
2. **Google OAuth works fine** - problem is only guest endpoint missing from deployed code
3. **Local backend works perfectly** - we just need Railway to catch up

### üîß Alternative: Railway CLI
If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

This will force an immediate deployment.
